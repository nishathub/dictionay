Need to make a Readme file..

Features:

Error handle:
if word not found, show a message
if api connection problem, show another message

Input typing:
automatic focus on the Input field on page load
after typing 2 letters, a message appears gently just above the Input field

synonyms and antonyms link:
by clicking on synonyms and antonyms, words can be searched
to clarify the service, they are listed underlined


audio:
the audio player has been hidden and replaced by the play button
there are multiple audio sources for backup.
if any word does not have an audio pronunciation, play button disappears
check it by typing 'interface'
i had to do error handle here to do so.

definitions:
there are multiple word arrays and inside them another multiple sets of definitions
by searching any word, all of them will be visible.

same goes for examples, parts of speech
